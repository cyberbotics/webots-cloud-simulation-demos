# 7: local-assets
This folder contains:
 - A `webots.yaml` file that is mandatory for the simulation to be published on webots.cloud.
 - A `worlds` folder containing the thumbnail (optional) and the world.
 - A `protos` folder containing the local protos we want to use.

You can see in `worlds/local_proto_demo.wbt` the ways the different textures and protos are loaded.

You can see the simulation on webots.cloud [here](https://webots.cloud/run?version=R2022b&url=https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots-cloud-simulation-demos/blob/main/7_local_assets/worlds/local_assets_demo.wbt)
